During my PhD I have been working on different **localization techniques**, i.e. with systems and algorithms providing an estimate of the physical location(s) of some device(s). This research area also includes tracking systems (i.e. continuous estimation of trajectories of moving devices), radar systems (where the target is usually non-cooperative), robot navigation systems, etc. Wikipedia contains a [page about Real-time Location Systems (RTLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_locating_system) which provides an overview about some aspects of this wide research area.

Additional information are available on the [website](https://www.sigcomm.unimore.it/) of the lab that hosted me during my PhD; in particular more information are available on the [page about indoor positioning](https://www.sigcomm.unimore.it/algorithms-for-positioning-and-navigation-in-indoor-and-vehicular-scenarios/).

As effort to comply with the [Open Science movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science), I published the source code (mostly MATLAB code) which I developed during my PhD and which was used to generate the numerical results of my papers. All the code is accessible through [my SourceForge project collecting my scientific research code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/frm-research/) or through the links below.

More details about some of my research work will be available in my [PhD thesis](https://morethesis.unimore.it/theses/available/etd-01142013-121728/) (however, it is not publicly available for now).

The rest of this page lists my publications organized differentiating between journal, conference and submitted publications. Note that some information about my publications are also available on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=aMyZpiwAAAAJ).
