Just some additional automated replacement I like to perform in my BibTeX files:

the following subtitution ensures that titles are surrounded by double curly brackets 
(so that BibTeX will respect upper case characters) in the title tags
@STRING{"^\s*title\s*=\s*{([^}]+)}," = "title = {{\1}},"}

the following subtitution ensures that each equal sign has one space on the left and one on the right
@STRING{"(\w+)\s*=\s*{(.+)$" = "\1 = {\2"}
 
the following subtitution ensures that there are no final spaces
@STRING{"[ \t]*}}[ \t]*,[ \t]*$" = "}},"}
