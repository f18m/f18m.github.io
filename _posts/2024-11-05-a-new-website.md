So it was about the time.
I redesigned my homepage, moving it from a static XHTML and XSLT based website
(one of my own invention back from the 2010) to a more modern [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-based
website hosted using Github Pages.

I also updated all of the pages and I hope the new website looks nicer too!
