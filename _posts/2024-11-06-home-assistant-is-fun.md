In the last year I've been using [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) quite a lot.
I believe it's a really awesome project that allows you to get control of your home and 
create automations that make you feel like you're living in the 21st century.

If you never used it, I suggest you check it out.

In meanwhile here are a few links to some good HW that I'm using for my home automations:

* [Everything Presence Lite](https://everythingsmarthome.github.io/everything-presence-lite/): a cheap and open presence sensor... this is working so well... definitively give it a try
* [SONOFF Zigbee Dongle](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus-e/)
* Aqara light sensor T1
* Aqara FP2
* Raspberry PIs... several <i class="fa-solid fa-face-grin-hearts"></i>
* [Annke C800 PoE security camera](https://www.annke.com/products/c800?srsltid=AfmBOopgbJByaHZxawFnDWsiqwwRLGLPrX20bUWImhwQkfE0Zc0icJbJ)
